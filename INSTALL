Rollout Server installation instructions:

1. Install apache or some other web server.

2. Extract rollout into a directory accessable to the web server

3. Configure the access list in .htaccess to allow your IP ranges.
 ^ THIS IS THE ONLY SECURITY ROLLOUT HAS (so far), SO GET IT RIGHT ^

4. Run rollout on a client, using something like the following:
   URL=http://rollout.domain; wget -O- $URL/rollout | perl - -s -u $URL

   Replace "rollout.domain" with the hostname or IP of your rollout server. You
   also may need to add a path to the URL if rollout isn't in the root
   directory of the domain.
